# NetTango Models Library

A preliminary version of a "Models Library" for NetTango models.

As of December 2020, users should think of this as a centralized repository for NetTango models developed by the CCL and NOT as a formal Models Library. Many things would need to happen before we might make this more publically available including, but not limited to:

- [ ] Automated tests to ensure file validity with the newest verions of NetTango
- [ ] Automated tests to ensure content is spell-checked, doesn't contain broken code, etc.
- [ ] Directory-map generation
- [ ] Insert other things we need to think about here.

## Current Plan (subject to change)
* This repo will only host NTJSON files.
* These files will be stored in a directory structure according to model content, a la NetLogo/models.
* This repo will be a submodule on either the CCL or NetLogo site, that is automatically updated when those repos are updated and pulled to the server.
